# Author Philip Couling
# This file is used by the package-project script
#
# This quite simply lists which files from this project to put where on the target system.
# Blank lines and lines starting with a '#' are ignored as white space and comments and. 
# The special folder DEBIAN is used by dpkg-deb automatically 
# to control the project.
#
# Instructions are formed of four sections separated by one or more spaces (NOT TABS)
# Backslashes "\" may be used to add spaces to names Eg "My\ Documents"
# Multiple tabs between two fields is allowable.
#
# action    [source]  [target]  [file-mode]
# Acttions:
#       source <source>
#            Changes the current source directory. This is very helpful when the manifest exists in a
#            subdirectory of the project.  The path is always relative to the manifest file.
#
#       control <source>
#            copies a file to DEBIAN/control. If SVN in installed and the current source file in 
#            a working copy, the revision number will be appended to the version number. Also the size
#            will be replaced by the actual size at the end of packaging 
#
#       file <source> <target> <file-mode> 
#            adds a file or dir from the project to the target system (parent dirs are created
#            automatically with a similar mode). This can also be used to place entire directories
#       
#       dir <target> <file-mode> 
#            creates an empty dir and changes it's mode. This is useful when the parent dir
#            should have very different permissions to its children
#
#       link <source> <target>
#            creates a symbolic link on the target system. Source is relative to the target link
